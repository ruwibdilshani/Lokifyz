# Encrypto Server üîê

Welcome to **Encrypto Server**! This is the backend server for the **Encrypto** application, which handles encryption and decryption of sensitive data. It uses modern encryption techniques to ensure that your data is securely processed and stored.

## Overview üõ†Ô∏è

**Encrypto Server** provides a backend API for encrypting and decrypting sensitive information. Built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Prisma**, this server allows you to integrate encryption capabilities into your application easily.

### Features

- **Encryption**: Securely encrypt sensitive data using AES and other cryptographic algorithms.
- **Decryption**: Easily decrypt data when required.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API endpoints with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Database Integration**: Store encrypted data securely in a MySQL database using Prisma.
- **Dev Environment**: Supports live-reload during development with **nodemon**.

## Tech Stack ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the server.
- **Express**: Web framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **Prisma**: ORM for working with MySQL databases.
- **bcryptjs & bcrypt**: For securely hashing passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For managing authentication with JWT.
- **dotenv**: For environment variable management.
- **MySQL2**: MySQL database connector for Node.js.

## Installation üöÄ

Follow these steps to set up the Encrypto Server on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amliyanage/Encrypto-server.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd Encrypto-server
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
   - Set up your database connection and other sensitive environment variables in the `.env` file.

5. **Run the server:**
   For development mode with automatic reloading:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The server should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Scripts üìú

- **Development Mode**:  
  `npm run dev`
